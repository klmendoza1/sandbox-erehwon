<p><strong>AMAZING F</strong> was conceived and curated in March 2014 by June Poticar Dalisay to
  pay homage to women in celebration of International Women’s Month. The members
  of KASIBULAN (Kababaihan sa Sining at Bagong Sibol na Kamalayan), an all-women-artists’
  group, actively participated in the group exhibit. The artworks focused on
  women’s issues such as inequality, domesticity, woman as healer and nurturer,
  and woman as exploited object. </p>
