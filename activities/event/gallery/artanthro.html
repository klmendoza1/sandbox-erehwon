<p><strong>“Art and Anthropology: Portrait of the Object as Filipino”</strong> is a project of Dr.
  Almira Gilles, a writer and social anthropologist and a Research Associate at
  the Field Museum of Natural History in Chicago. Two huge paintings measuring
  27 x 7 feet were created through the interaction of 5 Filipino American artists
  from Chicago and 5 Filipino artists from the Philippines. These murals made use
  of Philippine artifacts as images in creating 2 compositions. Dr Gilles remarked,
  “A mute object is animated by historical narratives that reside deep in the
  collective memory of its original producers and users.”  The mural that was
  completed in the Philippines can be viewed at the Ground Floor Lobby of the
  Erehwon Center for the Arts Building</p>
