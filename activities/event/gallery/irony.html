<p><strong>Irony</strong> was an exhibit in May 2016 of metal sculptures by students of the UP
  College of Fine Arts, featuring the ironic marriage of organic forms and
  industrial materials. The participants made use of the innate catalytic nature
  of heat and the welding process to bring iron and scrap metal to life. Metal
  discards were transformed into dynamic sculptures that captured the forms of
  animals and the human body. </p>
