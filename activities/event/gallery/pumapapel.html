<p><strong>Pumapapel</strong> was a group show in February 2015 that made use of paper as its
  main medium. The artists created two- and three-dimensional pieces from small
  to big formats. Most pieces were mostly paintings on paper using water-based
  media, and drawings using lead or charcoal pencils and pen and ink. There were
  compositions framed under glass of paper cuts, and paper sculptures as well. A
  group of students from the University of the Philippines College of Fine Arts
  exhibited etchings and monoprints.</p>
