<p><strong>Bastion</strong> opened in June 2016, a group exhibit of 2nd year students from the
  University of the Philippines College of Fine Arts, Diliman. The exhibition
  drew inspiration from the Arte Botanica: Piging, an installation that makes
  use of organic materials or discards of nature and environment. Bastion features
  floral and faunal resources as a way of creating circles of protection, preservation,
  and inquiry. Therefore, images of nature are preserved, alternatives presented,
  and issues questioned.</p>

<h1 class="writeup-highlight">What is Nature?</h1>

<p>We are said to be stardust, as iterated by a plethora of artists and scientists.
  Man, animals, plants, and the earth we live in, are composed of the same elements
  and compounds as the cosmos. Yet, the underlying unity is often forgotten, and
  borders are drawn.</p>

<p>With the advancements in urbanization, natural resources are destroyed and encroached
   upon. The Philippines, possessing one of the most ecologically diverse territories,
   continues to struggle with maintaining balance. Deforestation, water pollution,
   soil erosion, and over exploitation have caused numerous species to become critically
   endangered and extinct. But there is hope, with efforts from private and public
   organizations- the environment will heal undoubtedly, in time.</p>

<p>Drawing inspiration from Arte: Botanica “Piging”, this exhibition aims to showcase
  art which features floral and faunal resources as a way of creating circles of protection,
  preservation, and inquiry. Through “Bastion,” images of nature are preserved, alternatives
  are presented, and issues are questioned.</p>

<p>We do not live in nature, for we are Nature</p>
