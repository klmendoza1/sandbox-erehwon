<p><strong>Arte Botanica “Piging”</strong> is a group installation spearheaded
  by artist June Poticar-Dalisay to pay homage to Nature and Mother Earth, for
  her countless gifts to humankind. The Erehwon Art Collective together with the
  artists from an all-women group, KASIBULAN, came together to feature artworks
  made of organic materials and discards of nature. The exhibit is also a protest
  against the destruction of the environment. The exhibition is on going and can
  be viewed at the Ground Floor Lobby of Erehwon Center for the Arts Building.</p>
